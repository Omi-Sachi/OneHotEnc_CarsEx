
Here where i write what went wrong and how i fixed it

First thing that went wrong: I couldn't read my csv file by calling the name i'd get the error file
 doesn't exsist in directory. - So i fixed that by copying the path and calling that isnide my pd.csv()
fixed that problem right up!!!

Second thing i was having problems with was removing categorical data from the df and also concatating it.
I was taught to create an old column and remove that from the df but this did not work old code:

# Remove categorical columns (will replace with one-hot encoding)
old_columns = df.drop('Car Model', axis=1)

# Add one-hot encoded columns to numerical features
OH_column = pd.concat([old_columns, OH_column], axis=1)

Mistake one - Didn't use inplace = False, inplace will tell the computer wether i should return a new df or 
alter the exsisting one. This caused my required Object column called Car Model to not be able to be concantaded.

I could have corrcted it to this:
# Remove categorical columns (will replace with one-hot encoding)
old_columns = df.drop('Car Model', axis=1, inplace=False)  # Add inplace=False

# Add one-hot encoded columns to numerical features
df = pd.concat([old_columns, OH_column], axis=1)  

But i saw online a different method using:

OH_column = pd.DataFrame(Encoder.fit_transform(df[Cols_to_OH]).toarray(), columns=Encoder.get_feature_names_out(Cols_to_OH))
