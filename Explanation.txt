
Here is where I write what went wrong and how I fixed it

The first thing that went wrong was, that I couldn't read my CSV file by calling its name. I'd get the error message 'file
 doesn't exist in the directory.' - So I fixed that by copying the path and calling that inside my pd.read_csv() fixed that problem right up!!!

The second thing I was having problems with was removing categorical data from the df and also concatenating it.
I was taught to create an old column and remove that from the df but this did not work old code:

# Remove categorical columns (will replace with one-hot encoding)
old_columns = df.drop('Car Model', axis=1)

# Add one-hot encoded columns to numerical features
OH_column = pd.concat([old_columns, OH_column], axis=1)

Mistake one - Didn't use inplace = False, inplace will tell the computer whether I should return a new df or 
alter the existing one. This caused my required Object column called Car Model to not be able to be concatenated.

I could have corrected it to this:
# Remove categorical columns (will replace with one-hot encoding)
old_columns = df.drop('Car Model', axis=1, inplace=False)  # Add inplace=False

# Add one-hot encoded columns to numerical features
df = pd.concat([old_columns, OH_column], axis=1)  

But I saw online a different method using:

OH_column = pd.DataFrame(Encoder.fit_transform(df[Cols_to_OH]).toarray(), columns=Encoder.get_feature_names_out(Cols_to_OH))

This was a great lesson!!! Can't wait to keep Learning...
